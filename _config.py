> **This bot allows you to download videos and audio, and also work with playlists.**
> 
> • Simply send a video link and the bot will start downloading.
> • For playlists, specify the range of indexes separated by asterisks (e.g. `https://example.com*1*4`) to download videos from position 1 to 4.
> • You can set a custom playlist name by adding it after the range (e.g. `https://example.com*1*4*My Playlist`).
> 
> • To change the caption of a video, reply to the video with your message – the bot will send the video with your caption.
> • To extract audio from a video, use the **/audio** command (e.g. `/audio https://example.com`).
> • Upload a cookie file to download private videos and playlists.
> • Check or update your cookie file with **/check_cookie**, **/download_cookie**, **/save_as_cookie** and **/cookies_from_browser** commands.
> • To clean your workspace on server from bad files (e.g. old cookies or media) use **/clean** command (might be helpfull for get rid of errors).
> • See your usage statistics and logs by sending the **/usage** command.
